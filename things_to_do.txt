Need to implement the following modules:

FRCSR and FSCSR
Flags
Denormalized Numbers -> simple just add a check -> if exp == 0 then leading bit = 0.
All of the Converts (CVRT_W_S, CVRT_WU_S, CVRT_S_W, SVRT_S_WU) (Definitely need to be checked) 
Strict FSQRT implementation - current one kinda sucks.
Finish Pipeline (Done?)
Implement Roundings (Done?)

Later:
Implement Memory Calls
Implement Floating Point to Int and Vice Versa - Design is already implemented but it needs to be in the top level.
